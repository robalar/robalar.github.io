I am a self-taught, self-titled programmer from England. I enjoy breaking things and putting them back together (with questionable sucsess). 

I am always willing to learn and improve, if I've done something wrong - or inefficently - email me (rbthales@gmail.com) or send me a [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/robalardev) and the post in question shall be ammended (with credit!).
